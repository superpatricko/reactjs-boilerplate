Boilerplate to start fast with Reactjs

## Requirements

* [git](http://git-scm.com)
* [node](https://nodejs.org)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/about)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/superpatricko/reactjs-boilerplate YOUR-APP-NAME

# Install node modules
npm install

# Run gulp
gulp

```

You may need to stop gulp (ctrl + c) and execute the command again because it needs to finish bundling all the files before it can open anything

## Deployment
After you've run gulp, your files are ready to go in the dist/ folder
